        <!-- WPF causes an error with SourceLink because its build targets create a temporary project without a PackageReference to SourceLink, see https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/issues/91,
         causing the @SourceRoot property to be unexpectedly empty for the MapSourceRoot task
        
         For context, see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Compilers/Core/MSBuildTask/Microsoft.Managed.Core.targets
         and https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Compilers/Core/MSBuildTask/MapSourceRoots.cs
         
         This workaround sets the SourceRoot manually to some deterministic value to keep the promise given by having DeterministicSourcePaths set to true -->
